# colors

Hi! 

This program creates different colored vector triangle images using Java's graphics classes. It creates the images with the Drawing class, and the TwitterColors class uses twitter4j to tweet out a picture every 6 hours using the twitter account @scalenecolors. The bot runs remotely on a dyno on Heroku.
